**Hey there!**

I'm Morgan, a Technical Support Engineer and Implementation Specialist from grand ol' Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When I'm not fixing customer issues, I'm fixing houses (I love fixing things!). Below are some of the things I've been working on. Take a look!


1. Create a new search for Yippy.com using YSA (based on core Vivisimo Velocity 7.5-6 technology). Build display, crawl data sources, tweak configurations, and implement new features based on a set of requirements:

(http://www.yippy.com/ "Yippy.com")

2. Write a technical guide for the Yippy YSA applicance.
